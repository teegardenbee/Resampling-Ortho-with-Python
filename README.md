# Resampling-Ortho-with-Python

"Resampling" refers to the process of changing the number of pixels in an image by adding or removing pixels.
In this Script, I used the GDAL Warp function to resample an RGB ortho with reference to a DEM increasing the pixel size of the RGB ortho to that of the DEM.
